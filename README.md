# ECM-Image-Quantification-Toolbox
This toolbox is meant for the quantification of features from extracellular matrix images and was primarily intended for use with images obtained via confocal microscopy. Additionally, the toolbox could be potentially useful with images obtained via SHG and EM. This toolbox was developed in MATLAB and communicates with ImageJ via the ImageJ-MATLAB plugin. Current capabilities are volume fraction calculation, basic cell anaysis (eccentricity, count, density, etc), and fiber/fibril orientation distribution. The goal of this project was to create an easy to use and easy to modify product which could quantify characteristcs from large batches of images. If you have any issues, please make a ticket and/or email Daniel.Deuel@colorado.edu. Finally, if you make any changes/improvments to the code it would be greatly appreciated if you made a pull request to make it available to anyone interested.

Developed in the University of Colorado Boulder Extracellular Matrix Laboratory by Daniel Deuel with advising from Dr. Callan Luetkemeyer and Dr. Tyler Tuttle. Citations for the plugins used in the toolbox can be found in the !READ_ME folder.
